Transform the atmosphere of the provided image to switch its vibe entirely. If the original photo depicts a bustling city street during the day, re-imagine it as a serene, moonlit scene with the glow of street lamps and the quiet of late night. For a picture of a dense forest, alter it to look like an autumnal haven with warm hues and fallen leaves, or into a wintry escape with snow-laden trees and a soft snowfall. Should the original be a beach scene, envision it during a dramatic sunset with deep oranges and purples, or as a misty dawn with gentle pastel tones. In each transformation, adjust elements such as lighting, weather, and additional details to fully convert the mood and essence of the scene, while maintaining the integrity of the original composition. The goal is to retain the fundamental subjects of the image but to present them in a completely different emotional context or time of day, effectively performing a 'vibe switch'.
